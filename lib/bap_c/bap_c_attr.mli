(** Attribute processing.

    This module allows to attach a semantic action for C attributes. Each action
    is a term transformation, that should do nothing, if an attribute is not
    known to him. *)

type 'a pass = attr -> 'a term -> 'a term
(** a type of action *)

val register : sub pass -> unit
(** register an action *)
